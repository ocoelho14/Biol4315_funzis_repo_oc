## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r c1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

I am going to load the ggplot2 package and plot a scatter plot of spped vs dist form the cars dataset

```{r c2}
library("vegan")
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of speed vs dist",
       x = "Speed",
       y = "Distance")
```
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 nextgenusfs/funannotate
conda create -n sequali_env python=3.10 -c conda-forge 
conda activate sequali_env
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda sequali
```
